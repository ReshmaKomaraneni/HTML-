<h1>MY STYLING PROPERTIES</h1>
<p class="para1">Animals play an essential role in human life and planet earth. Ever since an early time, humans have been using animals for their benefit. Earlier, they came in use for transportation purposes. Further, they also come in use for food, hunting and protection.</p>
<p class="para2">Flowers consist of a combination of vegetative organs â€“ sepals that enclose and protect the developing flower. These petals attract pollinators, and reproductive organs that produce gametophytes, which in flowering plants produce gametes.</p>

You are not your age
Nor the size of clothes you wear,
You are not a weight,
Or the colour of your hair.
You are not your name,
Or the dimples in your cheeks,
You are all the books you read,
And all the words you speak,
You are your croaky morning voice,
And all the smiles you try to hide,
You're the sweetness in your laughter,
And every tear you've cried.
You're the songs you sing so loudly,
When you know you are all alone,
You're the places that you've been to,
And the one that you call home,
You're the things that you believe in,
And the people that you love,
You are the photos in your bedroom,
And the future you dream of.
You are made of so much beauty,
But it seems that you forgot,
When you decided that you were defined,
By all the things you are not.

<p id="borders">A paragraph is a group of sentences that are related to a single topic and are organized in a coherent way. Paragraphs are a fundamental part of writing, and are used to structure and organize written work. They help the reader follow the author's thoughts and understand the main points of a piece of writing.</p>
<p class="text">Fruits are the means by which angiosperms disseminate their seeds. Edible fruits in particular have long propagated using the movements of humans and other animals in a symbiotic relationship that is the means for seed dispersal for the one group and nutrition for the other; humans, and many other animals, have become dependent on fruits as a source of food.[1] Consequently, fruits account for a substantial fraction of the world's agricultural output, and some (such as the apple and the pomegranate) have acquired extensive cultural and symbolic meanings.</p>
